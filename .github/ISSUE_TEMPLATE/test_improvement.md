## 🧪 Test Improvement Description

**What testing aspect needs improvement?**
A clear description of the current testing gap or improvement opportunity.

**Current State:**

- Test coverage: XX% (run `python scripts/automated_test_report.py` to check)
- Specific modules affected: [list modules]
- Testing pain points: [describe current issues]

## 🎯 Improvement Category

**Type of Testing Improvement:**

- [ ] 📊 Coverage Enhancement (increase test coverage)
- [ ] 🚀 Performance Testing (benchmarks, load tests)
- [ ] 🔄 Integration Testing (API, end-to-end workflows)
- [ ] 🛡️ Security Testing (vulnerability, penetration testing)
- [ ] 🤖 Test Automation (CI/CD, automated reporting)
- [ ] 🔧 Test Infrastructure (tools, frameworks, utilities)
- [ ] 📝 Test Documentation (guides, best practices)
- [ ] 🐛 Test Reliability (flaky tests, test stability)

## 📊 Coverage Analysis

**Current Coverage Status:**

```bash
# Run this command to get current coverage
python scripts/automated_test_report.py
```

**Specific Coverage Gaps:**

- Module: `models/predictor.py` - Coverage: XX%
- Module: `data_pipeline/transforms/` - Coverage: XX%
- Module: `apps/api/routers/` - Coverage: XX%

**Target Coverage:**

- Overall target: 80%+ (current: XX%)
- Module-specific targets: [list specific goals]
- Timeline: [when to achieve target]

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

**What tests are missing?**

- [ ] Unit tests for specific functions/classes
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Edge case and error condition tests
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Mock and stub tests for external dependencies

**Specific Test Cases Needed:**

1. **Test Case**: [describe scenario]
   - **File**: `tests/unit/module/test_specific.py`
   - **Coverage**: Function X, lines Y-Z
   - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

2. **Test Case**: [describe scenario]
   - **File**: `tests/integration/test_workflow.py`
   - **Coverage**: End-to-end workflow A
   - **Priority**: High/Medium/Low

## 🛠️ Proposed Implementation

**Testing Strategy:**

- New test files to create: [list files]
- Existing tests to modify: [list files]
- Test utilities needed: [fixtures, mocks, helpers]

**Technical Approach:**

```python
# Example test structure
def test_specific_functionality():
    """Test description"""
    # Arrange
    setup_data = create_test_data()

    # Act
    result = function_under_test(setup_data)

    # Assert
    assert result.meets_expectation()
    assert coverage_improved()
```

**Test Data Requirements:**

- Mock data needed: [describe test data]
- External service mocking: [APIs, databases]
- Performance test scenarios: [load patterns]
